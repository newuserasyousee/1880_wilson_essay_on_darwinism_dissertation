Darwinism
Charles Darwin in his work
on The Origin of Species does
not purport to be philosophical.
He does not speculate on the
origin of the universe or on the
nature of matter and force.
He speaks simply as a
naturalist; as a skilled and
careful observer. He sets before
himself a single problem; to
wit: how is the fauna and
flora of this earth to be ac-
counted for. To account for
the existence of matter and
life Mr. Darwin explicitly stated
his belief in a Creator.
