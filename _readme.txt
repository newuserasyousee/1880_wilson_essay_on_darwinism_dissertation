I chose my metadata set to focus on observable physical and structural features rather than textual content to address what is preserved and what is lost in digitization. As this dissertation came in as an 8-leaf manuscript with uniform layout, margins, and cursive ink writing on the recto sides, I decided to prioritize distinctive fields that could be reliably observed without full transcription. I included categories such as text density, binding visibility, paper condition, and ink color to document differences in material condition, such as the faded title page in grayer inks, as to the more preserved interior sides with browner inks. It was almost unidentifiable whether the cover page was in ink or in pencil, but given the nature of the dissertation, it can be concluded as ink, yet this still pointed to the limitation of the photography. Structural fields like content type and how the page starts (opening) were included for document organization, while page number and leaf number preserve the physical sequence, including the missing blank leaf 2 that was omitted during digitization. I ended up keeping the file names from p01 to p07 in order to avoid confusion and for the consistency of information flow, even though this digital numbering still alters the intended sequence by the author. These choices highlight the friction of digitization and capture what the photographs show (layout, color, and sequence) but also point to what they cannot convey, such as texture, ink absorption, and the material of this centuries-old manuscript.
